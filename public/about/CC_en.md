# Usage

<h2 id="h1_6">Use on TV Programs</h2>
If the speaker agrees, TED and TEDxFukuoka will allow excerpts from TED Talks and TEDxFukuoka presentations to be aired on television. We have to secure permission from each speaker for any media use not done by TED or TEDxFukuoka.

In order to approach the speaker with a proper request, we need a brief from the producer of the media segment being developed that details the intended use of the footage. For stations outside the U.S., background on the network’s reach and point of view are also helpful.
If the speaker agrees, we will provide the desired footage on a hard drive, standard DVD or data DVD. Depending on the particular conference, the footage will be delivered in one of these formats: DVCPro NTSC, DVCPro PAL, DVCPro NTSC Anamorphic or DVCPro HD 1080i60. Any conversion needed will be the network’s responsibility.
No licensing fees will be charged, but the footage must be accompanied by an on-screen credit (generally a lower-third) referencing www.ted.com , or both www.ted.com and www.tedxfukuoka.com if a TEDxFukuoka presentation is being used. We prefer the language “Full talk available at www.ted.com ” or “Full talk available at  www.ted.com and  www.tedxfukuoka.com ” in the case of TEDxFukuoka presentations.

<h2 id="h1_7">Documentary Use</h2>
Documentary filmmakers can use excerpts of TED Talks and TEDxFukuoka presentations within their films, provided the speaker agrees. TED and TEDxFukuoka must secure permission from each speaker for any use outside TED.

In order to approach the speaker with a valid request, you must provide TED and/or TEDxFukuoka with a brief from the filmmaker on how the footage will be used, the film’s perspective, and your distribution plan. We would also like to see brief bios of the creative team (producer, director, and so on).

If the speaker agrees, we will provide you with the footage on a data DVD in one of our standard formats. You are responsible for any conversion required. Depending on the particular conference, the footage will be delivered in one of these formats: DVCPro NTSC, DVCPro PAL, DVCPro NTSC Anamorphic or DVCPro HD 1080i60. We do not deliver footage on tape.

No licensing fees will be charged, but the footage must be accompanied by an on-screen credit (generally a lower-third) referencing www.ted.com , or both www.ted.com and www.tedxfukuoka.com if a TEDxFukuoka presentation is being used. We prefer the language “Full talk available at www.ted.com ” or “Full talk available at www.ted.com and www.tedxfukuoka.com ” in the case of TEDxFukuoka presentations.
