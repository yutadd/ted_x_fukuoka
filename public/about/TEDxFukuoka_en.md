TEDxFukuoka launched in 2012 in order to create a space for people in Fukuoka and the Kyushu area to exchange worthy ideas.  
The TEDxFukuoka initiative focuses on spreading captivating, worthwhile ideas from Fukuoka to the world, in addition to taking exemplary ideas from around the world and spreading them around Fukuoka.  
TEDxFukuoka also aims to contribute to strengthening Fukuokaâ€™s cultural atmosphere by creating a united environment amongst the speakers, volunteer staff members, and participants.
